# Bug Tracker
## A website built with Spring Boot and React to keep track of bugs in programming projects -----> https://bug-tracker.live <---

The project is made for my own educational purposes and is inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG824vBdYY8.  
For hosting I used https://www.digitalocean.com and the domain was purchased in https://www.name.com.  
  
The application allows you to:
- Choose one of the roles based on which you will have access to different actions and resources
- Register and log in or log in as demo user
- Create a project and manage its personnel
- Create tickets for certain project, comment on them and track their history
- See your profile specifications and change email or password
- Manage user roles as admin
   
Most important technologies and features used in the project:
- Java 11
- JavaScript
- Rest API
- Postgresql
- Hibernate
- Authentication and Authorization using JSON Web Token(JWT)
- Docker
- Unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito
